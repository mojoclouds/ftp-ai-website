          <h2>The Story</h2>
          <p>FTP.ai was born from a simple observation: the public is predictably wrong. After 25+ years of sports betting and 30+ years of software development, we built the system we always wanted — one that removes emotion, narrative bias, and gut instinct from the equation entirely.</p>

          <p>"Fade the Public" isn't just a catchy name. It's a proven contrarian strategy backed by decades of market data. When the majority of recreational bettors load up on one side, sportsbooks shade their lines — and value appears on the other side. Our machine learning models quantify that value with precision.</p>

          <p>We built FTP.ai on a foundation of Python, XGBoost, and PostgreSQL, with a fully automated pipeline that handles everything from data ingestion to prediction delivery. Every model is backtested against historical outcomes before it goes live. Every prediction comes with the data behind it.</p>

          <p>This isn't a tip sheet. It's a prediction engine — built by engineers, powered by math, and validated by results.</p>

          <h3>Markets Are Beatable</h3>
          <p>Sports betting markets are driven by public sentiment as much as probability. Where there's bias, there's opportunity — if you have the tools to measure it.</p>
