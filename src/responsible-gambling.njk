          <h3>Set a Budget</h3>
          <p>Only wager money you can afford to lose. Set a budget before you start and stick to it. Never chase losses by betting more than you planned.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Set Time Limits</h3>
          <p>Decide in advance how much time you'll spend on sports betting. Take regular breaks and don't let betting interfere with your daily responsibilities.</p>

          <h3>Stay Informed</h3>
          <p>Understand the odds and the risks. No prediction system, including ours, can guarantee profits. Variance and losing streaks are a normal part of sports betting.</p>

          <h3>Never Bet Under the Influence</h3>
          <p>Avoid making betting decisions while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or strong emotions. Clear thinking leads to better decisions.</p>
