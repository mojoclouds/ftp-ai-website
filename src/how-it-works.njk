        <h2 class="section-title">What Does "Fade the Public" Mean?</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">When the majority of bettors pile onto one side, sportsbooks adjust lines — creating value on the other side. We find that value.</p>

          <h3>The Public Bias</h3>
          <p>Casual bettors are influenced by narratives, brand-name teams, and recency bias. They consistently overvalue favorites, overs, and trending teams — creating predictable patterns in the market.</p>

          <div class="card-icon">🎯</div>
          <h3>The Contrarian Edge</h3>
          <p>When heavy public action moves a line, the contrarian side often carries positive expected value. Our models quantify exactly when and where these opportunities exist.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">From Data to Predictions</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Every prediction follows a rigorous, automated pipeline.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="steps">
        <div class="step fade-in">
          <div class="step-number">01</div>
          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>We continuously ingest data from multiple sources: public betting percentages, line movements, team and player statistics, situational factors (rest days, travel, injuries), weather data, and historical matchup performance.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
            <p>Raw data is transformed into hundreds of predictive features. We capture momentum, fatigue, public sentiment ratios, line movement velocity, and dozens of sport-specific signals tuned for each league.</p>

            <h3>Model Prediction</h3>
            <p>XGBoost ensemble models — trained and validated on years of historical data — evaluate every game. Each model outputs a predicted outcome, confidence score, and expected edge against the current line.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Signal Filtering</h3>
            <p>Not every game has an edge. Our system applies strict confidence thresholds and only surfaces plays where the model identifies a statistically significant advantage — typically when public sentiment diverges sharply from model output.</p>

            <h3>Delivery</h3>
            <p>Qualified predictions are delivered across multiple channels — Discord, email, SMS, and our platform — with full transparency on confidence levels, model reasoning, and relevant data context.</p>

          <p>Every model is validated against historical data before going live. We don't ship models that haven't proven themselves in backtesting.</p>
